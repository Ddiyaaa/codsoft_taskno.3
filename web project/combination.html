    <h1>Combination Formula Description</h1>

    <p>Combinations, often referred to as "n choose r," are a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. They represent the number of ways to choose <em>r</em> items from a set of <em>n</em> items without regard to the order of selection. Combinations are used in various applications, such as forming teams, selecting items, and more.</p>

    <p>Combination Formula</p>
    <p>The combination formula calculates the number of combinations (C) for selecting <em>r</em> items from a set of <em>n</em> items:</p>
    <pre>C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)</pre>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>C(n, r)</em> represents the number of combinations of <em>n</em> items taken <em>r</em> at a time.</li>
        <li><em>n!</em> denotes the factorial of <em>n</em>, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to <em>n</em>.</li>
        <li><em>r!</em> denotes the factorial of <em>r</em>.</li>
        <li><em>(n - r)!</em> denotes the factorial of the difference between <em>n</em> and <em>r</em>.</li>
    </ul>
