    <h2>Geometric Distribution Formula Description</h2>

    <p>The geometric distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of trials required for a success to occur in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. It is commonly used in situations where you want to find the probability of the first success occurring on a specific trial, such as the first successful attempt at a game or the first occurrence of an event.</p>

    <p>Geometric Distribution Formula</p>
    <p>The probability of the first success occurring on the <em>x</em>-th trial can be calculated using the geometric distribution formula:</p>
    <pre>P(X = x) = (1 - p)^(x - 1) * p</pre>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>P(X = x)</em> represents the probability of the first success occurring on the <em>x</em>-th trial.</li>
        <li><em>p</em> is the probability of success on a single trial.</li>
    </ul>
